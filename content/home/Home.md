Strong interactions among atomic particles can lead to  materials, such as some high-temperature superconductors, with unusual electronic and magnetic properties. Our research group at [ITP](http://itp.cas.cn) and [BeihangU](https://www.buaa.edu.cn) is focusing on **emergent many-body physics** and **ultra quantum states of matter** due to the intriguing interplay between correlation and topology. We aim to develop quantum many-body simulation techniques, e.g., **tensor networks**, **renormalization group**, and **deep learning techniques**, that provide reliable and accurate numerical access to thermal and dynamical properties of correlated systems. With state-of-the-art methods, we explore novel states of matter and reveal underlying manybody theory, in correlated materials that could possibily lead to intriguing applications in future quantum technology.
