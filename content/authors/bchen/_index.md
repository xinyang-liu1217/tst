My research interest focuses on efficient numerical simulations within the tensor network state ansatz,
to tackle novel phenomena in quantum manybody systems, including quantum spin liquid, unconventional 
superconductivity, topological states, etc. 

Working on the PyTorch library as well as the QSpace library, I have developed several efficient thermal 
tensor network methods, e.g. series expansion thermal tensor network (SETTN), exponential tensor 
renormalization group (XTRG) and differentiable tensor renormalization group ($\partial$TRG) for 
accurate thermal simulations of quantum manybody systems.
