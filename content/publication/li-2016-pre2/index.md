abstract: "Three different tensor network (TN) optimization algorithms are employed to accurately determine the ground
state and thermodynamic properties of the spin-3/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We found that the
√3 × √3 state (i.e., the state with 120◦ spin configuration within a unit cell containing 9 sites) is the ground
state of this system, and such an ordered state is melted at any finite temperature, thereby clarifying the existing
experimental controversies. Three magnetization plateaus (m/ms = 1/3, 23/27, and 25/27) were obtained,
where the 1/3-magnetization plateau has been observed experimentally. The absence of a zero-magnetization
plateau indicates a gapless spin excitation that is further supported by the thermodynamic asymptotic behaviors
of the susceptibility and specific heat. At low temperatures, the specific heat is shown to exhibit a T 2 behavior,
and the susceptibility approaches a finite constant as T → 0. Our TN results of thermodynamic properties are
compared with those from high-temperature series expansion. In addition, we disclose a quantum phase transition
between q = 0 state (i.e., the state with 120◦ spin configuration within a unit cell containing three sites) and √
3 × √3 state in a spin-3/2 kagome XXZ model at the critical point Deltac = 0.54. This study provides reliable and useful information for further explorations on high-spin kagome physics."
