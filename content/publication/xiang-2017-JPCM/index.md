abstract: "We report on anisotropic electrical, thermal as well as thermoelectric properties of the prototypical Weyl semimetal TaAs. Compared to the normal metallic behavior along a axis, TaAs is more electrically resistive along c axis and exhibits a semiconductor-like resistivity upturn below [Formula: see text] K. In the same temperature range, the thermal conductivity along c axis shows a pronounced maximum of 183 [Formula: see text] characteristic of a crystalline solid, three times higher than that of a axis. The thermoelectric power, while exhibiting enhanced values around room temperature, becomes diminished in a substantial range of temperature ([Formula: see text] K) for both axes. Together with the enhanced Nernst signals, this hints at a dominating ambipolar diffusion as is frequently seen in a compensated semimetal. An in-depth investigation of the anisotropic transport quantities is expected to yield deep insights into the propagating Weyl fermions in TaAs."
