abstract: "The criticality-enhanced magnetocaloric effect (MCE) near 
a field-induced quantum critical point (QCP) in the spin 
systems constitutes a very promising and highly tunable alternative 
to conventional adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration. 
Strong fluctuations in the low-$T$ quantum critical regime
can give rise to {a} large thermal entropy change and thus 
significant {cooling effect} when approaching the QCP. 
In this work, {through efficient and accurate many-body 
calculations,} we show there exists a significant inverse MCE
(iMCE) in the spin-1 quantum chain materials
(CH$_3$)$_4$NNi(NO$_2$)$_3$ (TMNIN) and 
NiCl$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ (DTN), where DTN
has substantial low-$T$ refrigeration capacity 
while requiring only moderate magnetic fields. 
The iMCE characteristics, including the adiabatic 
temperature change $\Delta T_{\rm ad}$, isothermal 
entropy change $\Delta S$, differential Gr\"uneisen parameter, 
and the entropy change rate, are {obtained} with {quantum} many-body 
{calculations at finite temperature}. The cooling performance, i.e., 
the efficiency factor and hold time, of the two compounds is also discussed. 
Based on the many-body calculations on realistic models for 
the spin-chain materials, we conclude that the compound DTN 
constitutes a very promising and highly efficient quantum magnetic 
coolant with pronounced iMCE properties. We advocate that such 
quantum magnets can be used in cryofree refrigeration for 
space applications and quantum computing environments."
