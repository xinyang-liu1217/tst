abstract: "The pursuit of quantum spin liquid (QSL) in the Kitaev honeycomb magnets has drawn intensive attention recently. In particular, α-RuCl3 has been widely recognized as a promising candidate for the Kitaev QSL. Although the compound exhibits an antiferromagnetic order under zero field, it is believed to be endowed with fractionalized excitations and can be driven to the QSL phase by magnetic fields. "
