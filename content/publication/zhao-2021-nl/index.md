abstract: "Heavy Fermion (HF) states emerge in correlated quantum materials due to the intriguing interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons but rarely appear in 3d-electron systems due to high itinerancy of d-electrons. An itinerant Kondoâ€“Ising model is established to reproduce the experimental results, explains the microscopic origin of the d-electron HF states in Fe3GeTe2, and inspires future studies of the enriched quantum many-body effects with Kondo holes."
