abstract: "The newly discovered high-𝑇𝑐 nickelate superconductor La3⁢Ni2⁢O7 has generated significant research interest. To uncover the pairing mechanism, it is essential to investigate the intriguing interplay between the two 𝑒𝑔, i.e., 𝑑𝑥2−𝑦2 and 𝑑𝑧2 orbitals. Here we conduct an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) study of the bilayer 𝑡−𝐽 model, directly in the thermodynamic limit and with orbitally selective parameters for 𝑑𝑥2−𝑦2 and 𝑑𝑧2 orbitals, respectively. The 𝑑𝑥2−𝑦2 electrons exhibit significant intralayer hopping 𝑡∥ (and spin couplings 𝐽∥) as well as strong interlayer 𝐽⊥ passed from the 𝑑𝑧2 electrons. However, the interlayer 𝑡⊥ is negligible in this case. In contrast, the 𝑑𝑧2 orbital demonstrates strong interlayer 𝑡⊥ and 𝐽⊥, while the inherent intralayer 𝑡∥ and 𝐽∥ are small. Based on the iPEPS results, we find clear orbital-selective behaviors in La3⁢Ni2⁢O7. The 𝑑𝑥2−𝑦2 orbitals exhibit robust superconductive (SC) order driven by the interlayer coupling 𝐽⊥, while the 𝑑𝑧2 band shows relatively weak SC order as a result of small 𝑡∥ (lack of coherence) but large 𝑡⊥ (strong Pauli blocking). Furthermore, by substituting rare-earth element Pm or Sm with La, we find an enhanced SC order, which opens up a promising avenue for discovering nickelate superconductors with even higher 𝑇𝑐"
