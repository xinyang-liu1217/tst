abstract: "Traditional magnetic sub-Kelvin cooling relies on the nearly free local moments in hydrate paramagnetic salts, whose utility is hampered by the dilute magnetic ions and low thermal conductivity. Here we propose to use instead fractional excitations inherent to quantum spin liquids (QSLs) as an alternative, which are sensitive to external fields and can induce a very distinctive magnetocaloric effect. With state-of-the-art tensor-network approach, we compute low-temperature properties of Kitaev honeycomb model. For the ferromagnetic case, strong demagnetization cooling effect is observed due to the nearly free Z2 vortices via spin fractionalization, described by a paramagnetic equation of state with a renormalized Curie constant. For the antiferromagnetic Kitaev case, we uncover an intermediate-field gapless QSL phase with very large spin entropy, possibly due to the emergence of spinon Fermi surface and gauge field. Potential realization of topological excitation magnetocalorics in Kitaev materials is also discussed, which may offer a promising pathway to circumvent existing limitations in the paramagnetic hydrates."
